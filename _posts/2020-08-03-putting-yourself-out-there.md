I love writing. When you're already a little, self-professed, "out there," there's no reason to keep it in, unless you want to. I have decided to share my weirdness with the world. Those in my life have a front seat to the freak show, but putting yourself and your content, whether written or visual, "out there," can be a little intimidating. What if no one likes me? What if people think I'm silly? What if?

The only W that you should be thinking about is WHY - why are you doing what you're doing? Why am I writing? Why am I putting my writing "out there?"

An avid journaler since I was a child, I used to write "Dear Dairy" entries daily. Yes, I was writing lots before I could even spell, but I had little to no reservations about it. I wrote whatever was in my head, with whatever level of awareness I had at the time.

Reading my old entries as a teen, I felt embarrassed. How could I say those things? But I did. I used the voice that I had at that time. That Katie, frozen in time writing to the ice-cream man, is still in there. Present-day Katie has grown up a little since then.

Now, I try to read back on my history with compassion – If you want to grow, you're going to make mistakes. I do go a little lighter on my seven-year-old self than the Katie from a few months ago, but I recognize the universal truth that it takes time to grow.

While I keep 99 percent of my writing private, it is something I want to share more. I've always been able to express myself best through writing. It gives me the time necessary to reflect, process, and organize my thoughts and emotions. It helps me to understand and to be understood - if only by myself.

Over the past year, I have made writing a daily ritual, and it has changed my life. I was able to navigate the challenging landscape of a toxic work environment with, not ease, but clarity. It's the kind of clarity that only the written word can bring amid chaos; the kind we write to weigh our options, pump ourselves up and let our feelings loose - out onto the page and out of our minds. After much writing, it was quite clear; I had to leave my job.

So I did. Then I sold my home and most of my possessions. This is my first post since going all-in on myself.

Why?

We live in an age of technological advancement that will continue to shape human existence for years to come. The internet has opened up a world of possibilities and a global audience. It is now possible to share your story, your perspective, your ideas with anyone who has an internet connection. It's now possible to start a movement, spread joy, and create lasting change, on an ever-increasing scale.

Stories are what will bind us together or tear us apart. I want to write to bring people together, in our similarities and not differences. We all have to start somewhere, and no matter where this journey takes me – those are values that, I hope, will continue to guide me.

This life is too short to let opportunities pass you by, and publishing my content to a global audience will be a success by any of my metrics because I am trying. I believe in stories. I want to tell real stories. My stories. So I went all-in on this personal journey. While I haven't published anything since right before the sale of my home, I've continued writing and creating content that I plan on sharing. It's not so much the creation, but the sharing that I find difficult.

My biggest fear is that if people don't like my stories, it will somehow negate them, or worse, who I am (which is a ridiculous thought indeed as I type it out). That's the key though - writing it out. The tricky thing about thoughts is that they can pose as reality. Writing helps to expose them for what they are – just thoughts. I create my reality.

We all worry, and we all want to be liked, but our stories are our own – no one else can tell them but you. So write. You will be both recognized and challenged by your labour, but the fruit it bears is too sweet to pass up.

Do I have doubts? Only the kind that can keep you up ruminating until 5 am from time to time. Fear of failure is a part of life. Though, the only thing that guarantees your failure is not trying at all. I'm sure I will read words back to myself as time passes and feel embarrassed, but that is just a natural part of the learning process.

I am figuring this thing out as I go along, "placidly amid the noise and the haste (Max Ehrmann)." That is enough. I am enough. You are enough.

Writing is my salvation and my comfort, as well as my mental barometer. So here I am, on the internet and out into the ether – putting my thoughts out for consumption, contemplation, and criticism. Criticism is just another part of life. Even the unconstructive kind can help us grow in ways that we never could imagine.

Humans have been telling stories since time immemorial, and they will continue to do so until time runs out. Until then, we have stories to entertain, teach, and inspire us. Maybe we can even extend our time here on the planet by doing so – you cannot deny the power of stories as catalysts for change.
