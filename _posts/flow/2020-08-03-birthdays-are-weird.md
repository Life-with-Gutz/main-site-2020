I started hooping in 2012, I started right around my birthday (lol if you’re still with me from PART ONE, thanks for letting me captivate your attention this long). In another present to myself, at 27, I organized some friends to go to Bonnaroo with me. I remember first hearing about the festival years earlier from my friend, Cam. It looked like so much fun, but at the time I wondered how one could spare a week’s vacation to go to a music festival instead of a trip to another culture or country. Traveling to new places has its merits and its downsides. I got over my snobbery, festivals became another thing I wanted to explore, so we packed up the car and headed down to Tennessee.

I’m not a sports girls, that’s my sister, a huge Raptors fan from day one. For me, music concerts, and later festivals, showed me the connection, enthusiasm, emotion, and the shared experience that comes with any live event really. Humans want to connect with one another. Over time, it seems we’ve gotten shyer and too concerned with how others see us, preferring instead to present a highlight only version of our lives (you can follow me on Instagram here BTW).

Going to an event and sharing an experience with others, particularly over a long weekend where you’re able to spend the time getting to know people and build a sort of makeshift community, allows you to connect to others and to places within yourself that you may have never been. I’ve had me many happy tears over the years in these spaces. It’s also where I fell in love with movement, and my first love was the hula hoop.

A week later back in Canada, I walked by an open hula hoop workshop with Jennifer and Emma. Thank you universe. I joined in the class and bought my first hula hoop not a week after I wanted to get one. Hula-hoop was kinda the gateway drug to flow arts. It slowly escalated over the years, climaxing at shoving “fire in my face hole” to quote the great Shade Flamewater, on my ‘birthday weekend’ last year.

I had no idea what the festival was going to be like…but when this mother fucker went on stage in his leather trench coat and top hat, I remember looking at Carly and saying, ‘this is going to be good - just look at this guy.’ He certainly had stage presence - he snorted flames out of his goddamn nostrils.

He danced to a great remix (which I have been playing on repeat since <3 Biggie) and performed through the weekend. On the Sunday, Shade and badass bitch Mini Azur taught a fire eating workshop, which was the one new thing I desperately wanted to try, even more so after watching all the performers. And, yes. Yes, eating fire made me feel like a basic, baby badass. But learning the basics is the first step, and if you want to try it, only do so under professional guidance. Shade and mini are great teachers, check them out for lessons.

So yeah, birthdays are weird.

At this stage in my life, birthdays are now a time for me to honour myself - how lucky I am to be living the life I am, and all of the wonderful people I share it with. They’re also a chance to con my friends into doing weird shit that challenges them. I know I’m forcing some reluctant friends out to an Ecstatic Dance tomorrow night at Awaken Ottawa where we’ll drink cacao and center our heart chakras, followed by some singing bowls.

I always try to take a little piece of everything I experience away with me. I don’t think life should be lived only on the weekends. You can bring a piece of any experience into your everyday life, so choose wisely. Remember how happy you were when you took that vacation and did that thing? Playing like a child? How it felt to connect with others in a happy, vulnerable, and open way?  You’re still in there. Play has become an integral part of my life and I suggest you explore bringing more play into your life, and see what it can do for you. Dr. Shimi Kang’s whole talk in the link above is worth the watch.

I crave authenticity, and honestly, it’s not for everyone. I have a voice that I need to share and I want to just be myself. Oprah says that if you can align your personality with your purpose, then nobody can touch you. There’s obviously a lot of difficulties with being authentic on the internet, but I do really want to tell stories at my core. I want to get over my fear of sharing my most authentic self. Writing for me has long been a hobby. Reading is something I enjoy. And memes…don’t get me started on memes.
