    Life with Gutz is my adventure online. A place where I explore building a
    personal brand and using my voice amid the cacophony online. Personal Brand?
    It's cringey AF to say, but the internet is a great equalizer. It's my
    entrepreneurial adventure, and I don't know exactly where it's headed yet,
    but I plan on documenting the journey. In a world on fire that chews up
    people as nothing more than 'human capital,' I thought I'd start creating my
    own opportunities that don't harm and maybe even help...and I'm going to
    have fun doing it.
