  Luna Naughty: >-
    Luna Naughty has been involved in flowarts since 2012, when she first fell in 
    love with what she calls her ‘gateway prop,’ the hula hoop. Since then, she’s 
    been steadily training on a multitude of fire and LED props undertaking learning
    from some of the best performers in the world along the way, [Lisa Lottie](https://lisalottie.com/),
    [Lux Luminous](https://luxluminous.com/), and [Shade Flamewater](https://flamewatercircus.com/meet-the-team/shade-flamewater/).
    Born in Kingston and raised in Prince Edward county, Gutz spent the past decade
    in Ottawa where she has performed a variety of private and public shows, 
    including for The Ottawa Nature Museum and events like Harvest Noir. She is 
    very happy to get back to her roots and connect with the local arts community.
